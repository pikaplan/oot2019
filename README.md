# Object Oriented Tensorflow Tutorial 2019
## Description
This short tutorial was presented on 28th August 2019 at 16:30-18:30 EEST as part of the [Programming short course and workshop on Deep Learning and Computer Vision for Drone Imaging](http://icarus.csd.auth.gr/drone-school-2019/) of the [AIIA Summer School on Autonomous Systems](http://icarus.csd.auth.gr/summer-school-2019/). It covers the following topics:
* Getting started with Google Colab.
* Understanding Tensorflow primitives for developing complex machine learning models and methods.
* Leveraging the benefits of object oriented in Tensorflow programs.
* Training a state-of-the-art ResNet classifier on CIFAR10 benchmark dataset

## Getting started
